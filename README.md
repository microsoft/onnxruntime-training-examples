# ONNX Runtime Training Examples

This repo has examples for using [ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) (ORT) for accelerating training of [Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) models. These examples focus on large scale model training and achieving the best performance in [Azure Machine Learning service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) and [NVIDIA DGX-2](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-2). ONNX Runtime has the capability to train existing PyTorch models (implemented using `torch.nn.Module`) through its optimized backend. The examples in this repo demonstrate how [`ORTTrainer`](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/orttraining_rc1/orttraining/orttraining/python/ort_trainer.py#L480)* API can be used to switch the training backend for such models to ONNX Runtime with just a few changes to the existing training code. 

*_[ORTTrainer API](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/blob/orttraining_rc1/orttraining/orttraining/python/ort_trainer.py#L480) is experimental and expected to see significant changes in the near future. A new version of the API is under active development. The improvements to the API will provide a more seamless integration with PyTorch training that requires minimal changes in usersâ€™ training code._

## Prerequisites

The examples in this repo depend on a Docker image that includes ONNX Runtime for training. The docker image is available at `mcr.microsoft.com/azureml/onnxruntime-training:0.1-rc2-openmpi4.0-cuda10.2-cudnn7.6-nccl2.7.6` . The Docker image is tested in AzureML and DGX-2 environments. For running the examples in other environments, building a new Docker image may be necessary.

## Running the sample

Readme files for every example listed above provide a step-by-step instructions to execute the example.
