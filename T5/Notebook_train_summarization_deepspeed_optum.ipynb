        "This tutorial shows how to fine tune the T5 model to generate a summary of a news article. We then deploy it to an online endpoint for real time inference. The model is trained on a tiny sample of the dataset with a small number of epochs to illustrate the fine tuning approach.\n",

        "- Fine tune the T5 small model for the `Summarization` task with `Azure ML` \n",
        "- Leverage the `ACPT` environment with state of art accelerators\n",
        "- Increase training efficiency using [`DeepSpeed`](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) and [`ONNX Runtime`](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime)\n",
        "- Model Evaluation uring prebuilt component\n",
        "- Register the model with AzureML\n",
